<br>
<b>What is this project about?</b><br>
	•	This project aims to implement a movie ticket booking system making use of a web front end and a MySQL backend.<br>
	•	The project makes use of a combination of HTML, PHP, CSS and Bootstrap on the front end section.<br>
	•	A sample of 5 movies are up for booking.<br>
	•	Each movie has its own page with movie details and an option to make a booking.<br>
	•	Feature to book tickets in multiple theaters with multiple show timings have been provided.<br>
	•	Functionalities such as user login, user authentication, ticket cancellation etc have also been added.<br>
	•	Two SQL triggers and stored procedures have been used for handling the ticket booking and cancelling aspect.<br>
	•	All requisite data is stored onto tables in a MySQL server database.<br>
	•	This project was hosted on Apache 2.4 server.<br><br>
<b>How to run the program</b><br>
	•	Install Apache server. (I recommend XAMPP)<br>
	•	Install MySQL server.<br>
	•	Import database mini.mwb. (watch youtube tutuorials for this step)<br>
	•	Place the contents of the repository onto a new directory (say moviebooking) in the htdocs folder of Apache server.<br>
	•	Run the Apace and MySQL servers.<br>
	•	Open your browser and enter url for the the newly created directory.<br>
	•	This by default opens up Index.php and you can navigate from here using the web based interface.<br>
	•	Make sure to register as users and login to start making ticket bookings.<br>
	•	You can compare results with the backend MySQL schema "mini".<br>
