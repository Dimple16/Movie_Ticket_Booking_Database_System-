# Movie-Ticket-booking-System
A DBMS project that implements a movie booking system making use of PHP, HTML ,CSS, BOOTSTRAP and MySQL.

## What is this project about?

* This project aims to implement a movie ticket booking system making use of a web front end and a MySQL backend.
* The project makes use of a combination of HTML, PHP, CSS and Bootstrap on the front end section.
* A sample of 5 movies are up for booking.
* Each movie has its own page with movie details and an option to make a booking.
* Feature to book tickets in multiple theaters with multiple show timings have been provided.
* Functionalities such as user login, user authentication, ticket cancellation etc have also been added.
* Two SQL triggers and stored procedures have been used for handling the ticket booking and cancelling aspect.
* All requisite data is stored onto tables in a MySQL server database.
* This project was hosted on Apache 2.4 server.

## How to run the program

* Install Apache server. (I recommend XAMPP)
* Install MySQL server.
* Import database mini.mwb. (watch youtube tutuorials for this step)
* Place the contents of the repository onto a new directory (say moviebooking) in the htdocs folder of Apache server.
* Run the Apace and MySQL servers.
* Open your browser and enter url for the the newly created directory.
* This by default opens up Index.php and you can navigate from here using the web based interface.
* Make sure to register as users and login to start making ticket bookings.
* You can compare results with the backend MySQL schema "mini".
